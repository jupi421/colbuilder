"""
ColBuilder Error Codes Module

This module defines a centralized repository of error codes and their associated information
for the ColBuilder system. Each error code is categorized and includes a descriptive message,
suggestions for resolution, and optional links to documentation. This structured approach
enables consistent error handling, debugging, and user guidance throughout the pipeline.

Key Features:
--------------
1. **Error Code Structure**:
   - Each error is represented by a unique code (e.g., `SYS_ERR_001`).
   - Includes a human-readable message describing the error.
   - Provides actionable suggestions to resolve the issue.
   - Optionally links to relevant documentation for further guidance.

2. **Error Categories**:
   - **System (SYS)**: System-level errors (e.g., resource issues, dependency failures).
   - **Configuration (CFG)**: Errors related to configuration and setup.
   - **Sequence (SEQ)**: Errors during sequence generation and processing.
   - **Geometry (GEO)**: Errors during geometry generation and manipulation.
   - **Topology (TOP)**: Errors related to topology generation and force fields.

3. **Error Information**:
   - Encapsulated in the `ErrorInfo` named tuple, which includes:
     - `code`: Unique error identifier.
     - `message`: Description of the error.
     - `suggestions`: List of potential solutions.
     - `docs_url`: Optional link to relevant documentation.

Usage:
------
This module is used throughout the ColBuilder pipeline to provide consistent error handling
and user feedback. Errors can be referenced by their unique codes and include detailed
information for debugging and resolution.

Example:
--------
```python
from colbuilder.core.utils.error_codes import SYSTEM_ERRORS, ErrorInfo

# Access a specific error
error = SYSTEM_ERRORS["SYS_ERR_001"]
print(f"Error Code: {error.code}")
print(f"Message: {error.message}")
print(f"Suggestions: {', '.join(error.suggestions)}")
```
